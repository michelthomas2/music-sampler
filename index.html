  <h1> Stray Kids </h1>
  <p> Stray Kids, whose band name is often referred to as SKZ, is a South Korean boyband under JYP Entertainment. Although the band
    originally debuted in March of 2018 with nine members, they are currently an eight member band. The band members include Lee Know,
    Felix, Changbin, Hyunjin, Han, I.N., Seungmin, and their leader Bang Chan. Their fans are called Stays and one of the bands sayings
    is 'Stays make Stray Kids Stay'. Their music can often fit under the EDM genre, a genre I personally love. Their fast paced beats
    give me energy, making them great to listen to during workouts. Not only that but the band members themselves are all young and
    funny kids, with the age ranging from 19 to 23 years old. Although most of their music is in Korean, a language I do not speak,
    their music is able to transcend the language barrier, which is one of the many reasons I love them.</p>
